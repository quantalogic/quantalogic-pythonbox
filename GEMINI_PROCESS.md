## Step 4: Test Review

I reviewed the test files, including `test_python_interpreter.py` and `test_async_functions.py`, to assess the project's test coverage. The tests are comprehensive and cover a wide range of Python features, from basic syntax to advanced concepts like asynchronous operations, decorators, and generators. The use of `pytest` is a good choice for testing.
